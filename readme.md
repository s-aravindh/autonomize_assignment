# Problem Statement.
Here we have a simple problem, given a DNA sequence (of N, A, C, G, T), count the number of CpGs in the sequence (consecutive CGs).

We have defined a few helper functions / parameters for performing this task.

We need you to build a LSTM model and train it to complish this task in PyTorch.

A good solution will be a model that can be trained, with high confidence in correctness.
